     <h1>Note Sets and Math Projects</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Note Sets</h2>
      <p>Math can be too gatekeepy sometimes, so I thought it might be nice to upload some notes that I prepared as I was studying for my qualifying examinations. I hope you find these helpful for your studying needs as well. </p>
      <ul>

      <h2>Directed Reading Program</h2>
      <p> The Directed Reading Program (DRP) has become a staple in many math departments around the country. It is an opportunity for undergraduates to learn a more detailed subject that might not be taught at their universities. Additionally, it is a chance for graduate students to get more comfortable mentoring and explaining mathematical concepts. I have participated as both a mentee in undergrad and mentor at both Tufts and Emory. I think it is a great program for all involved and really have seen it blossom in smaller math departments where they can only teach the standard courses.</p>
    <p>In fact, I am on the steering committee of the <a href = "https://www.math.emory.edu/~drp/">Emory DRP</a>. If you are interested in getting involved in Emory's DRP, please see the link above. If you are a graduate student looking to start a DRP at your university, I would be happy to share some of my experiences. I also recommend you seek out other resources, e.g. the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/drp-network/">DRP Network</a>. </p>

      <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
      <p>Sometimes I need a break from the math I should be doing, with some math that I want to be doing. This spawns little projects that I find interesting, and I will upload them here, hoping you also find them interesting.</p>
