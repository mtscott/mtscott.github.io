    <h1>About me</h1>
<h3>Past</h3>
<p> I started at Cornell University in 2016 as a biological sciences student. However, the more math courses I took, the more I was hooked. By my junior year, I had switched to biological engineering, but that still wasn't enough math, so I added minors in pure math and applied math. I always knew I wanted to continue my education past a bachelor's degree, but I thought the additional math would help in some sort of biochemical engineering modeling. It wasn't until my senior spring that I realized I should study math in its own right. Taking a course on linear and nonlinear scientific computing as well as my senior design thesis, using computational fluid dynamics to model the reaction defusion equation in a human organ, caused me to see that this was what I wanted to study.</p>
<p> To solidify my mathematics fundamentals, I decided to pursue my master's degree at Tufts University. In the two years of the program, I excelled at fundamental courses to prepare me for further graduate coursework (real analysis I and II, abstract algebra) as well as courses in topics of interest to me (math modeling, numerical analysis). I worked on and successfully defended my master's thesis which deals with treating structured matrices as tensors and decomposing them so that we can precondition the system, and perform very fast matrix-vector computations. Lastly, I was a course assistant/ grader for Math 32 - Calculus I (Spring 2022) and Math 125 - Numerical Analysis (Fall 2022), mentor in a Directed Reading Program on mathematical control theory (Fall 2022) and presented talks at quantum computing, nonlinear dynamics, and geometric group theory reading groups.</p>
<h3>Present</h3>
<p> Currently, I am a first year Ph.D. student in computational math at Emory University. </p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>After I complete my Ph.D. degree, I plan on continung in academia through postdoctoral fellowships in math, applied math, computer science, or engineering. My research interests are in scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, and numerical parital differential equations. However, more broadly, my research interests are discovering the governing dynamics of the world we live in, summarized by:</p>
<blockquote cite="www.feynman.com">
"People who wish to analyze nature without using mathematics must settle for a reduced understanding." -Richard Feynman 
</blockquote>
<p>While my research is very important to me, another goal of mine is to become a better conveyor of information. I was spoiled to grow up watching Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) and Numberphile on Youtube, who explain math in a fun and approachable way. I have often felt overwhelmed in large classrooms and too self-conscious to ask questions, so I want to look into how to better present information and cultivate a culture of inclusion so that anyone can feel comfortable to ask the questions that they need to ask to learn. Math is intimidating enough, so anyone who wishes to study it should have all the support needed for them to prosper.</p>
