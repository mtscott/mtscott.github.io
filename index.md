<p>Hello! My name is Mitchell (any pronouns are fine), an engineer turned mathematician. I am currently a second year Master's student in Computational and Applied Mathematics at Tufts University. On top of finishing up my coursework, I am working on my thesis, focusing on tensor decompositions and preconditioning systems that arise in inverse problems like medical imaging. When I am not working on math, I enjoy reading fiction and running.</p>
