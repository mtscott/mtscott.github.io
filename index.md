<h1>Overview</h1>
<img src="ProfessionalHeadshot.jpg" alt="Headshot" style="width:172.8px;height:259.2px;" style="text-align:center;">
<p>Hello! My name is <b>Mitchell</b>, or <b>Mitch</b> (most pronouns are fine), an engineer turned mathematician. I am currently a second year master's student in computational and applied mathematics at Tufts University. On top of finishing up my coursework, I am working on my thesis, focusing on tensor decompositions and preconditioning systems that arise in inverse problems like medical imaging. When I am not working on math, I enjoy reading contemporary fiction and running.</p>
<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Past</h2>
<p> I started at Cornell University in 2016 as a biology student. However, the more math courses I took, the more I was hooked. By my junior year, I had switched to biological engineering, but that wasn't enough math, so I added minors in pure math and applied math. I always knew I wanted to continue my education past a bachelor's degree, but I thought the additional math would help in some sort of biochemical engineering modelling, and it wasn't until my senior spring that I realized I should study math in its own right. Taking a course on linear and nonlinear scientific computing as well as my senior design thesis, using computational fluid dynamics to model the reaction defusion equation in a human organ, caused me to see that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  </p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p> Currently, I am a master's student at Tufts. I have just completed my first year of a two year program, taking fundamental courses to prepare me for further graduate coursework (real analysis I and II, abstract algebra) as well as courses in topics of interest to me (math modeling, numerical analysis). I just started working on my master's thesis which deals with treating structured matrices as tensors and decomposing them so that we can precondition the system, and perform very fast matrix-vector computations. Lastly, I have been course stall for Calculus I (spring 2022) and attended/presented at quantum computing and nonlinear dynamics reading groups.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>After I complete my master's degree, I plan on continung in academia through a Ph.D. in math or applied math. This means I will be applying for the 2023 PhD cycle. My research interests are in scientific computing, mathematical modeling, numerical linear algebra, and inverse problems. However, more broadly, my research interests are discovering the governing dynamics of the world we live in, sumarized by:</p>
