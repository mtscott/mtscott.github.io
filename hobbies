    <h1>Overview</h1>
<img src="ProfessionalHeadshot.jpg" alt="Headshot" style="width:172.8px;height:259.2px;" style="text-align:center;">
<p>Hello! My name is <b>Mitchell</b>, or <b>Mitch</b> (most pronouns are fine), a biological engineer turned mathematician. I am currently a second year master's student in computational and applied mathematics at Tufts University. On top of finishing up my coursework, I am working on my thesis, focusing on tensor decompositions and preconditioning fractional PDEs that show up in financial modeling, turbulent fluid dynamics, and continuum mechanics. When I am not working on math, I enjoy reading contemporary fiction and running. I am currently training for my first marathon!</p>

    <h1>About me</h1>
<h3>Past</h3>
<p> I started at Cornell University in 2016 as a biological sciences student. However, the more math courses I took, the more I was hooked. By my junior year, I had switched to biological engineering, but that wasn't enough math, so I added minors in pure math and applied math. I always knew I wanted to continue my education past a bachelor's degree, but I thought the additional math would help in some sort of biochemical engineering modelling. It wasn't until my senior spring that I realized I should study math in its own right. Taking a course on linear and nonlinear scientific computing as well as my senior design thesis, using computational fluid dynamics to model the reaction defusion equation in a human organ, caused me to see that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  </p>
<h3>Present</h3>
<p> Currently, I am a master's student at Tufts. I am in my third semester of a two year program, taking fundamental courses to prepare me for further graduate coursework (real analysis I and II, abstract algebra) as well as courses in topics of interest to me (math modeling, numerical analysis). I just started working on my master's thesis which deals with treating structured matrices as tensors and decomposing them so that we can precondition the system, and perform very fast matrix-vector computations. Lastly, I have been course assistant/ grader for Math 32 - Calculus I (Spring 2022) and Math 125 - Numerical Analysis (Fall 2022), mentor in a Directed Reading Program on Mathematical control theory (Fall 2022) and presented talks at quantum computing, nonlinear dynamics, and geometric group theory reading groups.</p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>After I complete my master's degree, I plan on continung in academia through a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. I am currently applying to PhD programs to matriculate next fall 2023. My research interests are in scientific computing, numerical partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, and inverse problems. However, more broadly, my research interests are discovering the governing dynamics of the world we live in, sumarized by:</p>
<blockquote cite="www.feynman.com">
"People who wish to analyze nature without using mathematics must settle for a reduced understanding." -Richard Feynman 
</blockquote>
<p>While my research is very important to me, another goal of mine is to become a better conveyor of information. I was spoiled to grow up watching Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) and Numberphile on Youtube. I have often felt overwhelmed in large classrooms and too self-conscious to ask questions, so I want to look into how to present information and a culture of inclusion so that anyone can feel comfortable to ask the questions that they need to ask to learn. Math is intimidating enough, so anyone who wishes to study it should have all the support needed for them to prosper.</p>

    <h1>Math blog </h1>
<p>[Coming Soon] I hope to start a blog about mathematics that I think are interesting, that either come up in my own research, or just popular sources. I am also thinking about using this blog as a way of expressing some of my thoughts on issues that arise in PWIs that are perpetuating an exclusive mathematical community. </p>

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>[Coming Soon] As I mentioned above, I love reading books and running. I have been reading a lot of Kazuo Ishiguro recently. I am always open to book recommendations. I am also training for a marathon soon, so please send podcast recommendations for my Saturday Long Runs!</p>
